# Universal Quiz Game

##### This project is about a quiz game with questions from more than 20 categories, on different levels of difficulty.
##### The API used to grab data is: ***https://opentdb.com/***.
##### Project has been built using React.JS and SASS (for now)
 
<br />


## Improvements in progress:
 * Webpack with Babel for bundling and cross-browser friendly JavaScript 
 * Backend with a mongo db in which I want to store results based on player usernames
 * Improvements with SASS, mainly for responsive design and cross-browser friendly styling
 * (Maybe) Separate branch with MaterialUI implementation
